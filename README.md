# android-social-website-interactions
The project includes login and accessing data from social websites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox and Google Plus

Currently the project supports working prototype for following social network

1. Facebook
2. Twitter
3. Google Plus
4. Instagram
5. Dropbox

In addition for some social website integration, I have added examples to access information respective to social network for instance

1. For Twitter, I have added an example of searching the Tweets based on Hashtag and populate in Listview using Fabric
2. For Google Plus, added example is for accessing user information.

Coming soon

1. Login from Paypal account
2. Login form Linkend account

PS, if you want to use this, you just need to replace generated keys respective to social website integration or may be minor adjustments as per the needs.
